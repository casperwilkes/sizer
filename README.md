# Sizer

## Description
This is just a quick and dirty resizing program that I wrote. The purpose of the project is to 
resize images in a quick and effective way. There is nothing special or of note with this project.

This program could easily be pulled apart and reimplemented into another project. I just wanted to 
share it with anyone else who needs a quick and easy way to resize images. 

### Dependencies
Currently, the program only supports resizing with ImageMagick and the Imagick extension.

 - [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)
 - [Imagick](http://php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php)

### Todo
 - Add a way for program to detect whether to use ImageMagick or GD

#### Note
If there is anything you'd like to see added to this project, just let me know.
